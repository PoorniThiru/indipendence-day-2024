               with cowrie shells and dices. In time, the game underwent several modifications, but its meaning remained
                the same, i.e. good deeds take people to heaven and evil to a cycle of re-births.</li>

        <p  style="color: #010307; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif'; "  class="h5 mb-3">For almost two centuries the Britishers ruled over us. And the citizen of the country suffered a lot due to these oppressors. British officials treat us like slaves until we manage to fight back against them.
            We struggled for our independence but work tirelessly and selflessly under the guidance of our leaders Jawahar Lal Nehru, Subhash Chandra Bose, Mahatma Gandhi, Chandra Shekhar Azad, and Bhagat Singh. Some of these leaders choose the path of violence while some choose non-violence. But the ultimate aim of these was to drive out the Britishers from the country. And on 15th August 1947, the long-awaited dream come true.
